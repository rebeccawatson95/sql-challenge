#### Instructions:
It’s a beautiful spring day, and it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

#### ------------------
This homework assignment taught me the importance of what order I do things in. I realized once I started setting up the tables that I would need to create the tables that referenced a primary key last. This way the primary keys would already be set up. 

I think that using sql would be useful when sorting through and combining lists. It is a relatively easy way to to combine many lists that have limited columns.
