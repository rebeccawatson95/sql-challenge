This homework assignment taught me the importance of what order I do things in. I realized once I started setting up the tables that I would need to create the tables that referenced a primary key last. This way the primary keys would already be set up. 

I think that using sql would be useful when sorting through and combining lists. It is a relatively easy way to to combine many lists that have limited columns.
