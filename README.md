##### background:
It’s a beautiful spring day, and it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. In other words, I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
